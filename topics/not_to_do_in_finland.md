- go late
- "react to sexual-like jokes"
- bragg
- say compliments randomly -- when Finns say sth, they mean it -> if the first word you say to finnish woman will be "you're beautiful", you'll be called "kiss-ass"
- forget to take off shoes -- finns may take off shoes even there where you won't expect it, such as in random waschk√ºche -- since you may bring a lot of mess inside...
