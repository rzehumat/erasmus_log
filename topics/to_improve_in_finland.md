- too much lights at night -> switch them off / reduce
    - e.g. campus (some lights on 24x7 -- no need for that)
    - Teekkarikyl√§ -- 1/5 of lights would be enough
    - Espoo, Leppavaara -- do not enlight the buildings
- wasting heat
    - door open for too long
    - JMT 5 not using inner door
    - A-bloc door open for too long & are not double
- heat recuperation
    - sauna
    - computers
    - through heat pump?
- metro kinetic E recuperation
- more trees for the campus
