# Lessons learned from Finnish educational system
## inverted class
- IMO more time-demanding on both students and teachers
- requires high-quality studying materials (book / tutorials / videos) prepared and (in optimal case) reviewed in advance
- students study several chapters in advance, write short report (what have they learned -- just brief explanation of the topic) + questions (ALL of them) and send the report to the teacher
- (optionally) students can meet in small group (<= 5 students) and discuss the topic together + write additional short summary and questions as a group and send to teacher
- teacher receives all reports at least 24 hours before the contact session, reads it and prepare Q&A session to answer all questions and correct possible misconceptions identified in student reports -- such Q&A is highly rewarding for students, because it DIRECTLY FOCUSES on the hard and misunderstood topics while skipping the obvious ones
- students are expected to write all questions, regardless how bad they might be -- it's an important feedback for the teacher about how challenging the topic is
- in CZ -- somehow used during PRF teaching, LS 2021 -- thanks for that

## use modern stuff
- Slack for Q&A and discussion, especially in courses where a lot of bugs and issues is expected -- coding
- chat for teaching languages (of course in that language) -- e.g. Messenger / Telegram / WhatsApp
- links to tv series, videos or quizzes in teaching languages -- don't reinvent the wheel, if there are available materials, use them
- immediate feedback -- using slack; feedback forms send during semester, latest in the last week of teaching; students are often required to fill them to be classified -- for active students it shouldn't be any issue
- high use of ICT -- e.g. moodle, teams etc
- sharing all materials online, no need to go to the library
