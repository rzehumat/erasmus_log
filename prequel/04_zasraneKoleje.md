# how to search for accomodation in Helsinki metropolitan area
- HOAS application shall be put twice!
- ASAP HOAS & AYY even before confirmed place
- nothing in the end of June -> keep applications, but look for sth yourself -> see GitHub
- don't expect to get sth nice in front of campus, rather take anything
- (IMHO) Under 350 is rather an exception, I'd rather expect sth around 350 -- 450 (incl)... Under 450 is IMO not that hard to find, unless you wish sth nice, like Tapiola or Otaniemi
- was like "beginning of August still no accomodation = bad"... well, some didn't have any in half August ... but don't take inspiration from them
