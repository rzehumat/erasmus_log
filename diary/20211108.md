Jos sauna, terva ja viina ei auta, on tauti kuolemaksi
I have been living in the Czech Republic for one year. In Česke Budejoviče. 
It was nice, I was somehow struggeling with the language and MOST OF THE 
TIME I WAS DRUNK.

The tray to get lunch is too small for my lunch... Oh no, I have to reduce the salad :(
