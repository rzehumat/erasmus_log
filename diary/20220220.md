TORILLE!!!
Whole nation gets crazy about Olympic gold medails. 

The whole day was crazy, but that has stayed in my mind. While we were saying goodbye. They have not only all hugged me tightly, but they have literary said they aprove me as one of them, as a person approved to live in Finland. At first I've thought they might tell that just without seriousness, as words without reason, not meant to be taken seriously.
